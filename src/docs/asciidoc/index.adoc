This document provides an overview of the PostgreSQL Cache Plugin for Nextflow, designed to use PostgreSQL as a backend for storing execution cache data.

== Introduction

Nextflow's PostgreSQL Cache Plugin enables the storage of task execution metadata in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence and scalability. This plugin is particularly useful for workflows that require robust, centralized caching mechanisms across distributed environments.

== Changelog

- 2025-01-28 Release 1.0.0
* add log command

- 2025-01-01 Initial version 0.0.1-rc2

== Features

- **Centralized Cache Storage**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for consistent and reliable task execution caching.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale workflows with extensive caching needs.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures data persistence even in the event of node failures.
- **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with Nextflow's core caching framework.

== Prerequisites

Before using the PostgreSQL Cache Plugin, ensure the following requirements are met:

- A running PostgreSQL instance (version 11 or higher is recommended).
- Proper access credentials (username, password, host, and port) for the PostgreSQL database.
- Nextflow version 22.10.0 or newer. If you want to use new `log` command you need to use 24.11.0 or newer

== Installation

To install the PostgreSQL Cache Plugin, add the plugin to your `nextflow.config` file:

.nextflow.config
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id "nf-pgcache@0.0.1"
}
----

== Configuration

Configure the plugin by adding the PostgreSQL connection details to your `nextflow.config` file:

.nextflow.config
[source,groovy]
----
pgcache{
    host="localhost"
    port=5432
    database="postgres"
    user="user1"
    password="password1"
}
----

Replace `<host>`, `<port>`, `<database>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with the appropriate values for your PostgreSQL setup.

== Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured, it will automatically handle caching for your Nextflow workflows.

== Example

Here is an example of a simple workflow leveraging the PostgreSQL Cache Plugin:

[source,nextflow]
----
process sayHello {
  input:
  val x
  output:
  stdout
  script:
  """
    echo $x
  """
}

workflow {
  Channel.of('Bonjour', 'Ciao', 'Hello', 'Hola') | sayHello | view
}
----

Run the workflow with:

```
nextflow run myWorkflow.nf -resume
```

== Console log

You can check the cache status using the `log` command:

`nextflow plugin nf-pgcache:log`

```
TIMESTAMP               DURATION        RUN NAME                STATUS  REVISION ID     SESSION ID                              COMMAND
2025-01-28 10:06:38     11.9s           elated_noyce            ERR     5a90025ed9      5276a9cb-1999-4b95-bf8d-563a22373710    nextflow run main.nf -resume -c local.config
2025-01-28 10:07:02     11.6s           distracted_mcnulty      ERR     5a90025ed9      5276a9cb-1999-4b95-bf8d-563a22373710    nextflow run main.nf -resume -c local.config
2025-01-28 10:20:30     11.5s           crazy_wright            ERR     5a90025ed9      5276a9cb-1999-4b95-bf8d-563a22373710    nextflow run main.nf -resume -c local.config

```

If you use a recent nextflow version you can provide parameters to the `log` command

`nextflow plugin nf-pgcache:log --s '<->' `

`nextflow plugin nf-pgcache:log --fields timestamp,runame `

The idea is to use the same standard parameters as `nextflow log` command


== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure the following:

1. PostgreSQL is running and accessible.
2. The database credentials in `nextflow.config` are correct.
3. Required firewall or network settings are properly configured.


== Serverless options

In case you can't allocate a postgresql instance or your infrastructure doesnt allow it, you can try to
use a serverless options as Supabase or Neon

=== Supabase

The PostgreSQL Cache Plugin can also be used with a Supabase project.
Supabase provides a hosted PostgreSQL database that can be accessed from remote cloud machines.
This makes it an excellent choice for workflows running in cloud environments.

To configure the plugin for Supabase, follow these steps:

1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com.
2. Retrieve the database connection details from the Supabase dashboard, including the database URL, username, and password.
3. Update your `nextflow.config` file with the Supabase connection details:

[source,groovy]
----
pgcache{
    host="aws-0-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com"
    port=6543  //<1>
    database="postgres"
    user="postgres.xxxxxx"
    password="yyyyyy"
}
----
<1> Pay attention supabase use non default port

Ensure your cloud machines can reach the Supabase database.
Supabase provides public endpoints accessible over the internet, but you may need to configure network security rules for your environment.

Using Supabase with the PostgreSQL Cache Plugin ensures reliable, cloud-accessible caching for distributed workflows.

=== Neon

Similar to Supabase you can use Neon (https://neon.tech), another Open Source project who allow to you create a Postgre instance in a few seconds

Steps are very similar to Supabase so once you've created your project you'll be able to retrieve the config and creds to start using the database as cache

[source,groovy]
----
pgcache{
    host="ep-young-flower-b2xs0gwi.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech"
    port=5432  //<1>
    database="cache-demo"
    user=System.getenv("NEON_USER")
    password= System.getenv("NEON_PASSWORD")
}
----
<1> Neon use the default postgresql port
